                Early Political career
            </button>
            <div class="accordion-panel">
                Narendra Modi's early political career began in the early 1980s when he joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak
                Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organization, and subsequently became an active member of the Bharatiya
                Janata Party (BJP). His initial roles included working behind the scenes as an organizer and strategist.
                However, it was in 2001 that Modi's political trajectory saw a significant shift when he was appointed
                as the Chief Minister of the Indian state of Gujarat. His tenure in Gujarat was marked by both
                significant economic development and controversy, as it included handling the aftermath of the 2002
                Gujarat riots, which remains a contentious chapter in his political career. Despite the controversies,
                his leadership in Gujarat contributed to his rise within the BJP, eventually leading to his election as
                the Prime Minister of India in 2014.

        Narendra Modi served as the Chief Minister of the Indian state of Gujarat for a total of four terms. His first
        term began in October 2001, and he continued to hold the position until May 2014 when he became the Prime
        Minister of India. His tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat is characterized by a mixed legacy. On the one hand,
        his leadership was associated with significant economic development and infrastructure growth in the state,
        leading to the coining of the term "Gujarat Model" for development. On the other hand, his tenure was marked by
        controversy, notably for his handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, which resulted in significant criticism and
        allegations of mishandling the situation. During his time as Chief Minister, Gujarat became known for its
        business-friendly policies and industrial growth, which played a role in his later ascension to the role of
        Prime Minister.

        Narendra Modi assumed office as the 14th Prime Minister of India on May 26, 2014, after his party, the Bharatiya
        Janata Party (BJP), secured a decisive victory in the general elections. He was re-elected as Prime Minister in
        the 2019 general elections. During his tenure, Modi's government focused on several key initiatives, including
        "Make in India," "Digital India," "Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" (Clean India), and "Jan Dhan Yojana" (Financial
        Inclusion Program). He also introduced the "Goods and Services Tax" (GST) and initiated various economic and
        social reforms. Modi's leadership style and policies have evoked both strong support and criticism, and his
        tenure has been marked by important developments in India's domestic and foreign policies. For a more detailed
        account, you can refer to his Wikipedia page or other reliable sources.

        Narendra Modi is known for his somewhat private and ascetic lifestyle. He was born on September 17, 1950, in
        Vadnagar, a small town in Gujarat, India. He comes from a modest background and has often described his early
        years as a period of struggle. Modi is known for his simplicity, and he has been a lifelong member of the
        Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organization. He is a vegetarian and practices yoga
        regularly. Modi has often emphasized his commitment to public service and has not disclosed many details about
        his personal life. His private life remains relatively reserved and out of the public eye. For more detailed
        information, you can refer to his Wikipedia page or other reputable sources.

        Narendra Modi's role in tackling the 2002 Gujarat riots remains a subject of controversy and debate. As the
        Chief Minister of Gujarat at the time, Modi faced severe criticism for his government's response to the communal
        violence, which resulted in significant loss of life and property. Critics accused his administration of not
        doing enough to prevent the violence and failing to protect the minority Muslim community. On the other hand,
        Modi and his supporters argued that he took steps to restore law and order in the state and promote economic
        development in the aftermath of the riots. The 2002 Gujarat riots continue to be a contentious and polarizing
        chapter in Modi's political career, with varying opinions on his actions and responsibility during that period.

        Under Narendra Modi's leadership as the Prime Minister of India, several ambitious development projects were
        launched to drive economic growth, improve infrastructure, and address social issues. These projects include
        "Make in India," aimed at promoting manufacturing and job creation, "Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" to enhance
        sanitation and hygiene, "Digital India" to boost digital connectivity and e-governance, "Smart Cities Mission"
        for urban development, and "Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana" to provide affordable housing for all. These initiatives
        reflect his government's focus on economic reform, infrastructure development, and social welfare. They have
        played a pivotal role in shaping India's modernization and have garnered both support and criticism, making them
        integral aspects of Modi's governance legacy.
